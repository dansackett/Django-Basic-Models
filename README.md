Django-Base-Models
==================

Written in Python 3.x, but only a few changes are required to make these work in Python 2.x, such as the `super()` method, and changing `__str__` to `__unicode__`.

These models are inherently opinionated and intended as examples from which to draw inspiration. While You can copy them wholesale, it's going to often be a better idea to adapt them to your needs.
